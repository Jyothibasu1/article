                   <p>My experience as a teacher and researcher in Japan has allowed me to observe and study classrooms in depth. The first thing that caught my attention was the use of chalkboards. Sharing the same astonishment as Ermeling (2015), I wondered, ‘Why does Japan seem to lag in adopting 21st Century technology despite its reputation for technological advancements?’</P>


                   <p>I gradually learned how this seemingly rudimentary instructional medium is an indispensable teaching practice in Japan, termed ‘bansho’. Teachers plan and organise what to write on the board and use it to engage students in the lesson actively. This practice allows for an immersive learning experience that encourages student participation and collaborative knowledge building (Tan, 2022)

So, what do the different elements of bansho look like, and how can you implement it into your own teaching practice?</p>
